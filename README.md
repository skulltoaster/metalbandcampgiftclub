# Metal Bandcamp Gift Club

Welcome! We're a collective of metal nerds who enjoy gifting people music from their wishlist.

Make sure you have a Fan account on BandCamp:
https://bandcamp.com/fans

Then find people to follow:
https://bandcamp.com/sethw/following

Here is what someone's wishlist looks like:
https://bandcamp.com/v3rdict#wishlist




check out their Wishlist (here is my friend Jeremiah’s wishlist), and then click the “send as gift” link from their wishlist (this way it fills in the contact info for you).

I also like adding “#MetalBandcampgiftclub” to the “Send a note to the band” field when making the purchase, so the band sees the love. Happy gifting!

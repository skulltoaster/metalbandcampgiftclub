# Metal Bandcamp Gift Club

Welcome! We're a collective of metal nerds who enjoy gifting people music from their wishlist.

Make sure you have a Fan account on BandCamp:
https://bandcamp.com/fans

Then find people to follow:
https://bandcamp.com/sethw/following

Here is what someone's wishlist looks like:
https://bandcamp.com/v3rdict#wishlist

Check out their Wishlist, hover over an album, and then click the “send as gift” link from their wishlist.

I also like adding “#MetalBandcampgiftclub” to the “Send a note to the band” field when making the purchase, so the band sees the love. Happy gifting!

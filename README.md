# Metal Bandcamp Gift Club

Lindsey over at Scrap Yard Zine was the first to write about it in ‘#NiceMetalTwitter and the creation of #MetalBandCampGiftClub.’

> Using Bandcamp’s fan account, anyone can create a wishlist by favoriting artists, albums, labels, etc. MetalBandCampGiftClub members buy, at random, an album for a someone else. From there, you pay it forward, buying an album for someone else.

Make sure you have a Fan account on BandCamp (sign up here). Then find people to follow (here is a list of people I follow), check out their Wishlist (here is my friend Jeremiah’s wishlist), and then click the “send as gift” link from their wishlist (this way it fills in the contact info for you).

I also like adding “#MetalBandcampgiftclub” to the “Send a note to the band” field when making the purchase, so the band sees the love. Happy gifting!

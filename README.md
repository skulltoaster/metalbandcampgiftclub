# Metal Bandcamp Gift Club

Welcome! We're a collective of metal nerds who enjoy gifting people music from their wishlist.

Make sure you have a Fan account on BandCamp:

Here is what someone's wishlist looks like:

Check out their Wishlist, hover over an album, and then click the “send as gift” link from their wishlist.
